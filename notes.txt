Enqueue - 
1. Create a new_node. 
2. Allocate memory to a new_node
3. new_node->data = data
4. new_node->next = NULL
_____________________________
Check if something is already in queue.

if this is the first element, then 

queue->front = queue->rear = new_node;
sizeofQueue += 1

else 

queue->rear->next = new_node;
queue->rear = new_node;
sizeofQueue += 1

return 0;


Dequeue - 

1. create a temp node;
make temp node a copy of queue->front;
1. *data = temp_node->data; 
2. queue->front = queue->front->nxt;
free(temp node)


Delete - 
1. Error checking

uthread_create - 
1. if called for the first time, 
	initialize a empty queue;
	initialize thread;
	call function with args;
